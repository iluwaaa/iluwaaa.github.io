            <h2>Kaspersky Lab attributed the decline in the number of DDoS attacks to the rise in cryptocurrency
                prices</h2>

                <h3>18.02.2021</h3>
                <p>In the fourth quarter of 2020, the total number of DDoS attacks decreased by about 30% compared to
                    the
                    third quarter, according to data from Kaspersky Lab. Experts attribute this to the growth of the
                    price
                    of many cryptocurrencies.</p>
                <p>Analysts note that botnet operators have redirected some of the capacity to mining. Basically, the
                    share
                    of light attacks in the organization decreased, while the number of "smart attacks" did not fall too
                    significantly:
                </p>
                <p>"It is unprofitable for botnet operators to sell power on the cheap, losing profits from mining, and
                    when
                    prices rise, the first to be cut off are amateurs-schoolchildren, small hooligans and just hotheads
                    who
                    have no serious reasons for organizing DDoS."</p>
                <p>The leaders among the regions in terms of the number of "targets" and the number of attacks were
                    China,
                    the United States and Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>"In general, the events of the fourth quarter were kept within the trends of 2020. The attackers used
                    the
                    names of well-known APT groups to intimidate the victims, demanded a ransom in cryptocurrency and
                    staged
                    demonstration attacks that reinforce their threats, "Kaspersky Lab said.</p>
                <p>Recall, according to Atlas VPN, in 2020, as a result of hacker attacks on representatives of the
                    blockchain industry, almost $3.8 billion in cryptocurrencies was stolen.</p>
